# Advent of Code
This is all of my work for the Advent of Code challenges! I started in 2024 but foolishly didn't save my work, so I'll be adding my work here as I go back and complete them.

## Structure
I have each year's challenges in a respective directory, with subdirectories representing the day of each challenge.\
A brief description of the challenge (as well as a link to the website) will be provided in `.challenge.md`.\
The input files (if given) are stored as `.input`, and my solution(s) are stored as `solution.*` (answers are not stored).
