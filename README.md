# Advent of Code
This is all of my work for the Advent of Code challenges! I started in 2024 but foolishly didn't save my work, so I'll be adding my work here as I go back and complete them.

## Structure
I have each years challenges in a respective directory, with subdirectories representing the day of each challenge. The input files (if given) are stored as `.input`, and my solution(s) are stored as `solution.*`
